> Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry! In this case study - you are required to support Danny‚Äôs vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

 <br /> 


## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 5 datasets for this case study:

### **```users```**

Customer visits are logged at a `cookie_id level` and the `event_type` and `page_id` values can be used to join onto relevant tables to obtain further information about each event.

The `sequence_number` is used to order the events within each visit.

### üç± PRODUCT FUNNEL ANALYSIS

**Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:**

+ How many times was each product viewed?
+ How many times was each product added to cart?
+ How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
+ How many times was each product purchased?
+ How many times was each product viewed?
+ How many times was each product added to cart?
+ How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
+ How many times was each product purchased?

### üì¢ CAMPAIGNS ANALYSIS

> **Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique `visit_id` record and has the following columns:**

+ `user_id`
+ `visit_id`
+ `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
+ `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
+ `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
+ `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
+ `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the `visit_start_time` falls between the `start_date` and `end_date`
+ `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
+ `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
+ `cart_products` (Optional column): a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)
