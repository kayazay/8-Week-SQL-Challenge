## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

 <br /> 


## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **```sales```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The sales table captures all `customer_id` level purchases with an corresponding `order_date` and `product_id` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

|customer_id|order_date|product_id|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|A          |2021-01-01|1         |
|A          |2021-01-01|2         |
|A          |2021-01-07|2         |
|A          |2021-01-10|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|B          |2021-01-01|2         |
|B          |2021-01-02|2         |
|B          |2021-01-04|1         |
|B          |2021-01-11|1         |
|B          |2021-01-16|3         |
|B          |2021-02-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-07|3         |

 </details>

### **`menu`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The menu table maps the `product_id` to the actual `product_name` and price of each menu item.

|product_id |product_name|price     |
|-----------|------------|----------|
|1          |sushi       |10        |
|2          |curry       |15        |
|3          |ramen       |12        |

</details>

### **`members`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The final members table captures the `join_date` when a `customer_id` joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.

|customer_id|join_date |
|-----------|----------|
|A          |1/7/2021  |
|B          |1/9/2021  |
