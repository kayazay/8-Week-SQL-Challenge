## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows! Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world! This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

 <br /> 

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 2 key datasets for this case study:

### **```plans```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The `plans` table records all the subscription options that customers pay for (including the `trial` package) during their time with Foodie-Fi.
Details on the individual plans and the privileges that are available to subscribers can be seen here: - LKJLlkdlkd;;sdlak;dks;k;l;kdkj

| plan_id | plan_name     | price |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| 0       | trial         | 0     |
| 1       | basic monthly | 9.9   |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 19.9  |
| 3       | pro annual    | 199   |
| 4       | churn         |       |
 
 </details>

### **`subscriptions`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The `subscriptions` table show the exact date where each customer's specific `plan_id` starts.  
If customers downgrade from a **pro** plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over. When customers upgrade their account from a **basic** plan to a **pro** or **annual pro** plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.
When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the `start_date` will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service. 


| customer_id | plan_id | start_date |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| 299         | 2       | 2020-10-28 |
| 449         | 1       | 2020-01-13 |
| 679         | 4       | 2020-11-30 |
| 377         | 2       | 2020-03-17 |

| 367         | 2       | 2020-08-01 |
| 272         | 0       | 2020-12-19 |
| 785         | 2       | 2020-04-19 |

| 234         | 2       | 2020-01-26 |
| 210         | 4       | 2020-06-21 |

### B. CHALLENGE PAYMENT - QUESTIONS AND SOLUTIONS

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new  `payments`  table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the  `subscriptions`  table with the following requirements:
-   monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original  `start_date`  of any monthly paid plan,
-   upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately,
-   upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period,
-   once a customer churns they will no longer make payments.
