## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that he had one more genius idea to combine with his Pizza Empire - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched! Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters to customers. He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimize Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.
 <br /> 


## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 6 datasets for this case study:

### **```runners```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The `runners` table shows the `registration_date` for each new runner.

| runner_id | registration_date        |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1         | 2021-01-01  |
| 2         | 2021-01-03  |
| 3         | 2021-01-08  |
| 4         | 2021-01-15  |

 </details>

### **`customer_orders`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

Customer pizza orders are captured in the  `customer_orders` table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order. The `pizza_id` relates to the type of pizza which was ordered whilst the `exclusions` are the `topping_id` values which should be removed from the pizza and the `extras` are the `topping_id` values which need to be added to the pizza.

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions               | extras                   | order_time               |

There was need to clean this dataset because of data quality issues and a VIEW was created - `new_customer_order`, the DDL can be found in the general DDL script, and its rows are shown below. Also an extra column was added to track unique inidividual pizzas.

### **`runner_orders`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The `pickup_time` is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. The `distance` and `duration` fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer. 
**Note:-** Not all orders are fully completed and can be canceled by the restaurant or the customer, this information is found in the `cancellation` field.

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration   | cancellation            |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|

This dataset was inconsistent and had data quality issues also, so I had to create a VIEW - `new_runner_orders` to address these issues as well as join information from other tables.

  | order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration | cancellation            | registration_date        |

### **`pizza_names`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>
At the moment, Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available - the Meat Lovers or Vegetarian!

| pizza_id | pizza_name |
|----------|------------|
| 1        | Meatlovers |
| 2        | Vegetarian |

 </details>

 ### **`pizza_recipes`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

Each `pizza_id` has a standard set of toppings which are used as part of the pizza recipe.


| pizza_id | toppings                |
|----------|-------------------------|
| 1        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 |
| 2        | 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12      |

 </details>
 

### **`pizza_toppings`**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

This table contains all of the `topping_name` values with their corresponding `topping_id` value.

| topping_id | topping_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Bacon        |
| 2          | BBQ Sauce    |
| 3          | Beef         |
| 4          | Cheese       |
| 5          | Chicken      |
| 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 7          | Onions       |
| 8          | Pepperoni    |
| 9          | Peppers      |
| 10         | Salami       |
| 11         | Tomatoes     |
| 12         | Tomato Sauce |

 This table and the `pizza_recipes` table have obviuous connections and so I created this VIEW - `new_pizza_recipes` to join information from both tables and convey it in a more compact manner.

  | pizza_id | toppings                | toppings_indiv | topping_name |
|----------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 | 1              | Bacon        |

This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by 4 sections including: 
+ **Pizza Metrics**,  
+ **Runner and Customer Experience**,
+ **Ingredient Optimisation**, and
+ **Pricing and Ratings**.

### üöö RUNNER AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - QUESTIONS AND SOLUTIONS

To solve the questions in this challenge, I used the MATERIALIZED VIEW - `joined_pizza` that was created in the DDL query.

#### **Q1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01).**

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT runner_id,
    registration_date,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', registration_date) :: DATE + 4 AS week
  FROM
    pizza_runner.runners
)
SELECT
  week,
  COUNT(runner_id) AS num_runners
FROM
  t1
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC;
```

| week | num_runners |
|---------|-------------|
| 2021-01-01 | 2  |
| 2021-01-08 | 1  |
| 2021-01-15 | 1  |

---

#### **Q2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
  
```sql
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      runner_id,
      order_id,
      EXTRACT(
        'minutes'
        from
          AGE(
            pickup_time :: TIMESTAMP,
            order_time :: TIMESTAMP
          )
      ) AS arrival_time
    FROM
      joined_pizza
    WHERE
      pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2,
      3
  )
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(AVG(arrival_time) :: NUMERIC, 1) || ' minutes' AS avg_arrival_time
FROM
  t1
GROUP BY
  1;
```

| runner_id | avg_arrival_time |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 14.0 minutes     |
| 2         | 19.7 minutes     |
| 3         | 10.0 minutes     |

---

#### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      runner_id,
      order_id,
      rowcheck,
      EXTRACT(
        'minutes'

          AGE(
            pickup_time :: TIMESTAMP,
            order_time :: TIMESTAMP
          )
      ) AS arrival_time
    FROM
      joined_pizza
    WHERE
      pickup_time IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT
  arrival_time,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rowcheck)
FROM
  t1
GROUP BY
  1;
```

| arrival_time | count |
|--------------|-------|
| 10           | 4     |
| 15           | 2     |
| 20           | 1     |
| 21           | 2     |
| 29           | 3     |

---

#### **Q4. What was the average `distance` travelled for each customer?**
  
  ```sql
  WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      distance
    FROM

    WHERE
      distance IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2
  )
SELECT
  customer_id,
  ROUND(AVG(distance), 1) AS avg_distance
FROM
  t1
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  1;
```

| customer_id | avg_distance |
|-------------|--------------|
| 101         | 20           |

```sql
  WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      order_id,
      duration
    FROM
      joined_pizza
    WHERE
      pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2
  )
SELECT
  MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS max_difference
FROM
  t1;
```

| max_difference |
|----------------|
| 15             |

---

#### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      runner_id,
      distance / EXTRACT(
        'minutes'
        from
          AGE(
            pickup_time :: TIMESTAMP,
            order_time :: TIMESTAMP
          )
      ) :: NUMERIC AS delivery_speed,

    WHERE
      pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2,
      3,
      4
  )
SELECT
  runner_id,
  order_id,
  ROUND(AVG(delivery_speed), 2) || ' km/minute' AS delivery_speed
FROM
  t1
GROUP BY
  1,
  2
ORDER BY
  1,
  2;
```

| runner_id | order_id | delivery_speed |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1         | 1        | 2.00 km/minute |
| 1         | 2        | 2.00 km/minute |
| 1         | 3        | 0.64 km/minute |

#### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
  WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      runner_id,
      order_id,
      cancellation
    FROM
      joined_pizza
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2,
      3
  )
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(
    100 * SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) / COUNT(runner_id)
  ) || '%' AS delivery_percent
FROM
  t1
GROUP BY
  1;
```

| runner_id | delivery_percent |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 100%             |
| 2         | 75%              |

The table `joined_pizza` is shown below, to get an overview. 
   </summary>

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS toppings_table;
CREATE TEMP TABLE toppings_table AS (

#### **Q5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.**
```sql
  WITH todo_filter AS(
    SELECT
      order_id,
      pizza_name,
      order_toppings_row,
      STRING_AGG(
        CASE
          _count
          WHEN 1 THEN ''
          ELSE CONCAT(_count, 'x ')
        END || pizza_toppings.topping_name,
        ', '
      ) OVER(
        PARTITION BY order_id,
        pizza_name,
        order_toppings_row
        ORDER BY
          pizza_toppings.topping_name
      ) AS combined_toppings,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(

  )
SELECT
  order_id,
  pizza_name || ': ' || combined_toppings AS order_spec
FROM
  todo_filter
WHERE
  flag_num = 1;
```

#### **Q6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?**
```sql
SELECT
  pizza_toppings.topping_name AS ingredient,
  SUM(_count) AS frequency
FROM
  toppings_table
  LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings ON pizza_toppings.topping_id = toppings_table.toppings_per_order
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC;
```

| ingredient   | frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Bacon        | 13        |
| Mushrooms    | 12        |
| Cheese       | 11        |
| Chicken      | 10        |

### üí∞ PRICING AND RATINGS - QUESTIONS AND SOLUTIONS

<details>
<summary> To solve the questions in this challenge I created a VIEW that encompasses all fields required in the questions for this section D.

The view - `pizza_pricing` is shown below.
</summary>

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS pizza_pricing;
CREATE VIEW pizza_pricing AS (
  SELECT
    new_customer_orders.order_id,
    runner_id,
    pizza_name,
    customer_id,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(STRING_TO_ARRAY(exclusions, ','), 1) AS exclusions_num,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(STRING_TO_ARRAY(extras, ','), 1) AS extras_num,
    rowcheck,
    order_time,
    pickup_time,
    EXTRACT(
      'minutes'
      from
        AGE(
          pickup_time :: TIMESTAMP,
          order_time :: TIMESTAMP
        )
    ) AS time_btw_order_and_pickup,
    duration,
    cancellation,
    distance,
    ROUND(distance :: NUMERIC / duration, 2) AS average_speed
  FROM
    new_customer_orders
    LEFT JOIN new_runner_orders ON new_runner_orders.order_id = new_customer_orders.order_id
);
 ```
</details>

#### **Q1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?**
```sql
WITH todo_revenue AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    CASE
      pizza_name
      WHEN 'Meat Lovers' THEN 12
      ELSE 10
    END AS cost_per1,
    COUNT(rowcheck) AS num_pizzas
  FROM
    pizza_pricing
  GROUP BY
    1,
    2
)
SELECT
  SUM(cost_per1 * num_pizzas) :: MONEY AS revenue
FROM
  todo_revenue;
```

| revenue  |
|----------|
| $160.00  |

---

#### **Q2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?**
```sql
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT
      order_id,
      CASE
        pizza_name
        WHEN 'Meat Lovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10
      END - COALESCE(extras_num, 0) AS cost_extra_charges
    FROM
      pizza_pricing
    WHERE
      cancellation IS NULL
  )
SELECT
  SUM(cost_extra_charges) :: MONEY AS revenue_extra_charges
FROM
  t1;
```

| revenue_extra_charges |
|-----------------------|
| $134.00               |

<details>
<summary> Next I created a TEMP TABLE for all the required fields in subsequent questions.

The table  - `dwd_pizza_table` is shown below.
</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  SETSEED(0.9);
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dwd_pizza_table;
CREATE TEMP TABLE dwd_pizza_table AS (
    WITH todo_rating AS (
      SELECT
        order_id,
        runner_id,
        order_time,
        pickup_time,
        distance || ' km' AS distance,
        time_btw_order_and_pickup || ' minutes' AS time_btw_order_and_pickup,
        duration || ' minutes' AS duration,
        average_speed || ' km/min' AS average_speed,
        COUNT(rowcheck) AS total_number_of_pizzas
      FROM
        pizza_pricing
      WHERE
        pickup_time IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5,
        6,
        7,
        8
    )
    SELECT
      *,
      ROUND((random() * 5 + 0) :: INTEGER, 1) AS rating
    FROM
      todo_rating
  );
```
</details>

#### **Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.**

```sql
SELECT
  order_id,
  rating
FROM
  dwd_pizza_table;
```

| order_id | rating |
|----------|--------|
| 1        | 3      |
| 2        | 2      |
| 3        | 1      |
| 4        | 1      |
| 5        | 4      |
| 7        | 3      |
| 8        | 3      |
| 10       | 3      |

---

#### **Q4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?**
+ `customer_id`, `order_id`, `runner_id`, `rating`, `order_time`, `pickup_time`, time between order and pickup, delivery duration, average speed, and total number of pizzas.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  dwd_pizza_table;
```

| order_id | runner_id | order_time               | pickup_time     | distance | time_btw_order_and_pickup | duration   | average_speed | total_number_of_pizzas | rating |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------------------|------------|---------------|------------------------|--------|

#### **Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for `extras` and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?**

```sql
WITH todo_revenue AS (
    SELECT
      order_id,
      CASE
        pizza_name
        WHEN 'Meat Lovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10
      END AS cost_per1,
      COUNT(rowcheck) AS num_pizzas
    FROM
      pizza_pricing
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2
  ),
  final_revenue AS (
    SELECT
      SUM(cost_per1 * num_pizzas) :: MONEY AS revenue
    FROM
      todo_revenue
  ),
  runners_expenditure AS (
    SELECT
      SUM(distance) * 0.3 AS runners_cost
    FROM
      pizza_pricing
  )
SELECT
  (
    final_revenue.revenue :: NUMERIC - runners_expenditure.runners_cost
  ) :: MONEY AS leftover_revenue
FROM
  final_revenue,
  runners_expenditure;
```

| leftover_revenue |
|------------------|
| $95.38           |
