## 🛠️ This repository serves as my submission to Danny's SQL Challenge.
Throughout the Data with Danny Serious SQL course there were several case studies, and datasets from various industries were presented to gain mastery of tricks, techniques and best practice methods of solving data problems with SQL.
Concepts such as the following were rigorously explained with practice questions and brain teasers to drive the points home:

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs);
* Recursive CTEs;
* Temporary tables, Views, Materialized views and Indexing;
* Basic Joins;
* Complex Joins - Cross Joins, Anti Joins, Left Semi Joins;
* Window Functions;
* GROUP BY clause;
* REGEXP formatting techniques, and lots more.

In different ways, these concepts and tricks would be featured in one or more of my submission.


Once completed, this repo would hold 8 case studies
